    DynamicTable stored within the group.

- neurodata_type_def: IntracellularRecordingsTable
  neurodata_type_inc: AlignedDynamicTable
  name: intracellular_recordings
  doc: A table to group together a stimulus and response from a single electrode and
    a single simultaneous recording. Each row in the table represents a single recording
    consisting typically of a stimulus and a corresponding response. In some cases,
    however, only a stimulus or a response are recorded as as part of an experiment.
    In this case both, the stimulus and response will point to the same TimeSeries
    while the idx_start and count of the invalid column will be set to -1, thus, indicating
    that no values have been recorded for the stimulus or response, respectively.
    Note, a recording MUST contain at least a stimulus or a response. Typically the
    stimulus and response are PatchClampSeries. However, the use of AD/DA channels
    that are not associated to an electrode is also common in intracellular electrophysiology,
    in which case other TimeSeries may be used.
