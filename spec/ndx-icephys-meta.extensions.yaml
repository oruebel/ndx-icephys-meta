  doc: A table to group together a stimulus and response from a single electrode and
    a single sweep. Each row in the table represents a single recording consisting
    typically of a stimulus and a corresponding response. In some cases, however,
    only a stimulus or a response are recorded as as part of an experiment. In this
    case both, the stimulus and resposne will point to the same TimeSeries while the
    idx_start and count of the invalid column will be set to -1, thus, indicating
    that no values have been recorded for the stimulus or response, respectively.
    Note, a recording MUST contain at least a stimulus or a response. Typically the
    stimulus and response are PatchClampSeries. However, the use of AD/DA channels
    that are not associated to an electrode is also common in intracellular electrophysiology,
    in which case other TimeSeries may be used.
