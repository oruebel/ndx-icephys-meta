  doc: A table to group together a stimulus and response from a single electrode and
    a single sweep. Each row in the table represents a single recording consisting
    typically of a stimulus and a corresponding response. In some cases, however,
    only a stimulus or a response are recorded asas part of an experiment. In this
    case both, the stimulus and resposne will point to the samePatchClampSeries while
    the idx_start and count of the invalid column will be set to -1, thus,indicating
    that no values have been recorded for the stimulus or response, respectively.
    Note,a recording MUSt contain at least a stimulus or response.
